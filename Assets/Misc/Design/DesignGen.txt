level based. short levels, most of them probably confined within viewport boundaries.

star system: player can achieve 1 to 3 stars for each level, tied to various challenges (finish under set time, etc.....).

multiple worlds/themes, each containing smth like 8 to 16 individual levels.
worlds are distinct in their presentation (visuals, music) and (probably) one central mechanic. (except the first introductory world which serves as a 'tutorial world').

probably: all (or most) worlds are unlocked by default, but only their first respective level. new levels are unlocked by completing (achieving at least 1 star)
	  in newest currently unlocked level.


world (mechanic) ideas:
	- basket: to complete level, player doesnt need to collide with goal col but throw ball into physical 'basket'
	- coins: to 'unlock' goal col player needs to collect all 'coins' placed in level - coins are collected upon player col as well as ball col
	- buttons: activated upon player col or ball col. then... do smth. open doors? activate other mechanics? idk. not sure about this one.
	- gravity fields: areas / collisions within which gravity is reversed. probably only affects ball.
	- moving platforms: may seem too basic to be a world mechanic but dynamic level layouts make a BIG difference in combination with ball mechanic
	- no ball gravity: ball throwing becomes billard! ...or minigolf. or smth. no gravity, but drag, to prevent perpetual motion.
	- toxic tiles: 2 different types of solids - one toxic to player, one toxic to ball.
